# 🌪️ The Noise Must Flow

Welcome to **The Noise Must Flow**, your all-in-one lab for understanding, building, and experimenting with **diffusion models** — the noisy heartbeats behind today's most powerful generative AIs.

This repository provides a friendly, open-source playground to **demystify** diffusion models, especially DDPMs (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models).

This repository is based on the original DDPM paper: [Ho et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239). It is also inspired by the work of [Umar Jamil](https://github.com/hkproj/pytorch-stable-diffusion) and his video "[Coding Stable Diffusion from scratch in PyTorch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBKpAp_6TGI&t=13980s)" that I strongly recommend.
